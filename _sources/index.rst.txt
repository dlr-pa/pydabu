Welcome to pydabu's documentation!
==================================

Your data is nothing more than a data bubble, until it is:

  * described
  * shared
  * published

pydabu can help you to describe your data. Think of a simple kind of a
basic data management plan (cf. [wikipedia:DMP]_; [RDA_DMP]_),
which is good research practice (cf. [DFG]_; [Helmholtz]_).
